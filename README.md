# Remembered-Thinking-Theory: A Python Exploration

This repository is a starting point for exploring **Andrew Malcolm's Remembered-Thinking-Theory** through Python programming. The theory is presented in a PDF at andrewrichardmalcolm.com. The theory explores the nature of memory, certainty, and conceptual thinking, and this project aims to:

1. Present the core equations of the theory.
2. Explore falsification paths to test and challenge the theory.
3. Develop empirical evidence through experiments or simulations.
4. Invite collaboration from philosophers, cognitive scientists, and programmers, both academic and non-academic (the author is a non-academic novelist and philosopher)
5. Apply the theory to game theory and decision-making.
6. Investigate philosophical implications for epistemology, metaphysics, and AI.

## Summary Equations

The core equations of Remembered-Thinking-Theory are:

1. **External Memory Accuracy Degradation:**
   \[
   P_{external}(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 \times e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   - Represents the probability that a memory of an external observation is accurate over time.

2. **Internal Memory Accuracy Persistence:**
   \[
   P_{internal}(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   - Represents the probability that a memory of an internal thought is accurate over time.

3. **Conceptual-Expanse and Belief:**
   \[
   P_{M_xI}(t) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda t}\right)
   \]
   - Represents the limit of perfect belief in a concept as its perceived expanse approaches infinity.

## Future Directions

### 1. Falsification Paths
Explore ways to test and challenge the theory. For example:
- Can we design experiments to measure the accuracy of internal vs. external memories?
- Are there real-world scenarios that contradict the theory's predictions?
- Can the theory's assumptions, for example that thoughts are always unitized, be challenged?

### 2. Empirical Evidence Development
Review past research paroject, and develop experiments or simulations to gather data. For example:
- Simulate memory degradation and persistence in controlled environments.
- Collect data on belief formation and conceptual-expanse.
- Review experimental results relevant to assumptions about memory made by the theory.

### 3. Collaboration Channels
Invite contributions from philosophers, cognitive scientists, and programmers, both academic and non-academic. For example:
- Open issues on GitHub for discussion and collaboration.
- Host workshops or webinars to brainstorm ideas.
- Promote other's work that has enfolded the theory into their ideas.

### 4. Applications to Game Theory
Apply the theory to decision-making and strategic interactions. For example:
- Model how belief and certainty influence player strategies in games.
- Explore the role of conceptual-expanse in cooperative or competitive scenarios.
- Explore how power can be challenged through identificatiion of maladapted conceptual perfection both in the powerful and in those manipulated by power.

### 5. Philosophical Inquiry
Investigate the theory's implications for epistemology, metaphysics, and AI. For example:
- How does the theory redefine knowledge and belief?
- Can the theory inform the development of AI systems that mimic human thought processes?
- How can the theory contribute to philosophical inquiry into the existence or non-existence of causation?
