"""
Remembered-Thinking-Theory: A Python Exploration

This program is a starting point for exploring Andrew Malcolm's Remembered-Thinking-Theory.
It presents the core equations of the theory and outlines future directions for research,
collaboration, and application.

Summary Equations:
1. External Memory Accuracy Degradation:
   P_external(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 * e^(-λt)
   - Represents the probability that a memory of an external observation is accurate over time.

2. Internal Memory Accuracy Persistence:
   P_internal(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)
   - Represents the probability that a memory of an internal thought is accurate over time.

3. Conceptual-Expanse and Belief:
   P_MxI(t) = lim_{t→∞} (1 - e^(-λt))
   - Represents the limit of perfect belief in a concept as its perceived expanse approaches infinity.

Future Directions:
- Falsification Paths: Explore ways to test and challenge the theory.
- Empirical Evidence: Develop experiments or simulations to gather data.
- Collaboration: Invite contributions from philosophers, cognitive scientists, and programmers.
- Game Theory: Apply the theory to decision-making and strategic interactions.
- Philosophical Inquiry: Investigate implications for epistemology, metaphysics, and AI.
